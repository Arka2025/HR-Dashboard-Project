# Interactive Human Resources Dashboard

## Overview
This project is focused on creating an *Interactive HR Dashboard* using employee data to extract valuable insights. The dashboard will provide an overview of various HR-related metrics, such as employee performance, satisfaction levels, and demographic information. The goal is to apply the skills learned during the course in *Power BI* and *DEX functions* to generate data visualizations and uncover relationships between different variables.

## Project Files

### 3. Additional Data Files (Supporting files)
- *Rating File*: Contains educational level ratings (1 to 5) for employees, divided into categories such as High School, College, etc.
- *Performance Rating File*: Contains performance ratings from 1 to 5 to determine employee satisfaction (e.g., satisfied, unhappy, etc.).
- *Satisfaction Rate File*: Contains ratings from 1 to 5 that determine how employees or managers perceive performance and satisfaction levels.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze the relationships between various employee metrics and visualize the insights. By using Power BI and *DEX functions*, we will explore the following:

- Correlations between employee satisfaction and performance.
- Breakdown of employee attrition by department, gender, education level, etc.
- Visual representation of employee data and performance trends over time.
- Insights into training opportunities and their impact on employee satisfaction.

## How to Use
To interact with the dashboard, you can load the data files into Power BI and create various visualizations to uncover insights. Some potential visualizations include:

- Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for trends in performance and satisfaction.
- Heatmaps and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables (e.g., age, salary, satisfaction).
- Dashboards showcasing key HR metrics for easy analysis.

## Data Insights
The dataset contains a rich set of information that can be used to generate various insights. Some questions to explore:

1. *What are the factors influencing employee satisfaction?*
2. *How does employee satisfaction affect their performance rating?*
3. *What are the trends in employee attrition over time?*
4. *How do employees from different departments compare satisfaction and performance?*

## Technologies Used
- *Exel*: For cleaning and processing data.
- *Power BI*: This creates interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
- *DAX Language*: For advanced data manipulation and calculations.
